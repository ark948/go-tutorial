Starting to learn golang.


following the tutorial on the official website (go.dev)


1. Get started with Go
(I already have installed Go compiler)

- create a new folder called 'hello':
> mkdir hello
> cd hello


- Enable dependency tracking for your code:
a go.mod file tracks the modules provided by others (probably similar concept to package.json).
should be include in the repository.

to create this file:
> go mod init example/hello (yes, the tutorial was inside hello directory)

- create a hello.go file (did not exactly say where, i'm assuming in hello directory)
in this file:
a main package is declared. all files in the same directory belong to it.
fmt package is imported. it contains functions to work with text. part of standard library of Go.
a main function is declared. when the main package is ran, the main function will be executed by default. # IMPORTANT

- to run the code:
> go run .


Calling external packages:
they can be found at: pkg.go.dev

we'll import this 'rsc.io/quote' module and use it in hello.go:
(upon saving, vscode moved the import statement of this module next to the fmt import statement, it coupled them together)

- run the following command to aquire the modules (Go will do something called Authenticating the modules)
> go mod tidy (looks like Go downloads these modules)
a go.sum file is generated.

- now run the code:
> go run .
